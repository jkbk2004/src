# CMAQ.inline phot preprocessor
  FORTRAN and c code that creates a new CSQY_DATA table for a phtochemical mechanism

1) Copy the build/run script (inline_phot_preproc/scripts/bldrun.inline_phot_preproc)
   template under scripts into its parent directory.

2) IF NECESSARY, modify src/dumb.makefile based on the compilers and their flags 
   on your computer platform.

3) Change the build/run script for your application. 
   If application uses photolysis rates whose cross-section and quantum yields are 
   not listed under photolysis_CSQY_data, create the data files and add them to the 
   directory.
 
4) Execute the script. Inputs and reference outputs are provided under input and 
   output subdirectories based on mechanisms in CMAQ version 5.1.
