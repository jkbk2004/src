Orography mtnvar14 and land-sea mask generator - WCOSS version tar ball

The code generates the global orographic elevations on a given Gaussian lonb 
by latb grid with a spectral filter if requested from the USGS 30" input 
lon/lat array and 30" RAMP radar elevations (GICE) for Antarctic 30" 
elevations with the UMD lake mask and for the land sea mask and RAMP 
radar elevations (GICE) for Antarctic 30" elevations.  In addition, the 
mtnvar14 file gravity wave drag variance and higher moments, and 
Mountain Blocking files are generated.  An ocean model lsm can override 
the land mask keeping the lake mask intact (defaults off).  A low resolution 
190.384x190_128-192 (T190 382x190 Gaussian grid with a Quadritic filter 
from waves 128 to 192 - the last wave is not set to zero) setup file 
qbsub_mtnlsm190.384x190_128-192.sh 
is included with output and results as well as a current t1534 GFS 
SLG setup file.  This file can be used to submit a batch job orgmlw.sh.   
This script will compile the fortran code mtnlm7_oclsm.f, and execute the 
code, setting up the local input files and create a temporary directory for 
computation and transfer the files back to the starting dir.  Root directories
and names have been removed where possible.  Reset the fortran compiler and 
note that the program is running in r8 and the files are big-endian.  
The scripts use modules to set the link libraries and the module script is 
included as well as the lib source code and make files to compile these.  
An example Grads control file for reading the ieee files is included as Grads 
has trouble with the 14 record mtnvar14 file read as one record as the model
requries.  The single record orogb and slmgb grib files are read by grads.
