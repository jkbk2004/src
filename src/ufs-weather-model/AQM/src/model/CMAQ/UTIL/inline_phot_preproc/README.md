# CMAQ.inline phot preprocessor
FORTRAN and c code that create a new CSQY_DATA table for a photochemical mechanism

1) Copy and edit scripts/bldrun.inline_phot_preproc.csh for your compiler and Mechanism. Save and run to build the software.

2) IF NECESSARY, modify src/dumb.makefile based on the compilers and their flags on your computer platform.

3) If application uses photolysis rates whose cross-section and quantum yields are not listed under photolysis_CSQY_data, create the data files and add them to the directory.
 
4) Execute the script. Check the bldrun.log file if the executable does not produce CSQY_DATA table in the output directory.
