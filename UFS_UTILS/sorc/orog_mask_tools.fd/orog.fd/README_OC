 For this implementation:
! --- if mskocn=1 ocean land sea mask given/present, =0 if not present
! ---  OCLSM is real(*4)  array with fractional values possible
! ---  0 is ocean and 1 is land for slm
! ---  Step 1: Only change SLM after GFS SLM is applied
! ---  upgrade to fractional lsm with ice mask and lake mask separate later
! ---  SLM is only field that will be altered by OCLSM
! ---  Ocean land sea mask ocean points made ocean in atm model
! ---  Land and Lakes and all other atm elv moments remain unchanged.
 The LSM Gaussian file from the ocean model sometimes arrives with 
! --- 0=Ocean and 1=Land or it arrives with 1=Ocean and 0=land without 
! --- metadata to distinguish its disposition.
 In fortran code one should set these switches:
      MSKOCN = 1             ! Ocean land sea mask =1, =0 if not present
      NOTOCN = 1             ! =1 Ocean lsm input reverse: Ocean=1, land=0 
 as in
                   if (notocn .eq. 1)then
      print *,' Ocean LSM Reversed:  NOTOCN=',notocn
                    endif
 and the reversal will be undone.


If ocean land sea mask file is not present, the system will continue and 
no incorporate it.
